# Car Price Prediction: End-to-End Machine Learning Project with MLflow and AWS

This repository showcases an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting car prices using a variety of regression models. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and monitoringâ€”implemented with **MLflow** and **AWS** to ensure reproducibility and scalability.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Source**: Car price dataset with features like make, model, year, mileage, and other specifications.
- **ML Pipeline**: Built and managed using MLflow, covering:
  - Data ingestion
  - Data transformation
  - Data validation
  - Model evaluation
  - Model training with various regression algorithms
  - Hyperparameter tuning with MLflow's tracking and logging features
- **Deployment**: Model deployment using AWS services, enabling scalable access and real-time predictions.
- **Model Monitoring**: MLflow and AWS tools used for tracking model performance and updating models as needed.

## Tech Stack

- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking, model versioning, and parameter logging
- **AWS**: Model deployment and monitoring
- **Python**: Main programming language for data handling and model training
